    <h1 id="title">Welcome to My Homepage</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Eyob, and I am a passionate sports fan who spends most of my
      free time watching games—sometimes a little too seriously. I am a die-hard
      Chelsea supporter, and missing a match is simply not an option; if Chelsea
      are playing, plans can wait. I recently started watching Formula 1, and I
      will admit this season tested my emotions—supporting Max and watching him
      miss the championship was painful. I am also a proud Lakers fan, and I
      truly believe this could be our year. Luka is playing great, and even
      though LeBron is getting older, he is still the GOAT—no debate needed. In
      the NFL, I support the Ravens. The season did not start well, but hope is
      part of being a fan, and I am confident they can make the playoffs and
      finally bring the Lombardi Trophy home. When I am not watching sports, I
      am usually learning new things and working toward becoming a software
      engineer—so yes, my life is a mix of code, competition, and a lot of
      emotional support for my teams.

    <p>My favorite player from Chelsea is Reece James</p>
